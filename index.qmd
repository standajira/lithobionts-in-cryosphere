## Sampling and Methods

All samples were collected during one month in the Austrian Alps in 2023. They come from the Dachstein massif, Hochkönig massif, and Selbhorn. Below you can see maps with detailed geographical locations for each sample,

## Altitudinal zones

Sampling was conducted alongside an altitudinal gradient- ranging from 800 to almost 2,700 m a.s.l. We separated the gradient into separate zones for easier and more precise statistical analyses. The samples were assigned to the three groups based on the elevation of the sites – forest (800–1,700 m a.s.l.), transient (1,700–2,200 m a.s.l.), and alpine (2,200–2,700 m a.s.l.) zones. These zones were created on the basis of local vegetation types. Habitats with a stable cover of taller trees and shrubs were assigned to the forest zone. The transient zone typically did not have many taller trees, and the only form of vegetation were shrubs and grasses. The shrubs gradually disappeared, and only grasses and smaller herbs remained. This was the beginning of the alpine zone, which was completely devoid of vegetational cover (except for terricolous and saxicolous lichens) in its upper parts. You can see photos representing each zone with usual vegetation found there below.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
